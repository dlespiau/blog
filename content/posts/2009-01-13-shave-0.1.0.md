After a month without anyone shouting at shave in despair or horror, it's time to tag something to have a "stable" branch so people can rely on a stable interface (yes, it's important even for a 100 lines macro!).<br/><br/>What's the most amazing is that quite a few projects have adopted shave in the GNOME and freedesktop.org communities : Clutter, Niepce Digital, Giggle, GStreamer, GObject introspection, PulseAudio, ConnMan, Json-glib, libunique, gnote, seed, gnome-utils, libccss, <a title="shave + xorg" href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2009-April/044920.html">xorg ?</a> and maybe some more I've forgotten or I don't even know about.<br/><br/>You can grab the <a href="http://download.lespiau.name/shave/shave-0.1.0.tar.bz2">tarball</a> or clone the <a href="http://git.lespiau.name/cgit/shave/">git repositoy</a> (git clone git://git.lespiau.name/shave) and have a look at the <a href="http://git.lespiau.name/cgit/shave/tree/README">README</a> file.<br/><br/>Time to celebrate.
