In this case, a simple transition that I've seen somewhere a long time ago and I wanted to reproduce with Clutter.<br /><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3FjYJ_Z9PK0/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3FjYJ_Z9PK0?feature=player_embedded" width="320"></iframe></div><br />The code is available in a <a href="https://github.com/media-explorer/media-explorer/tree/wip%2Ftileout-effect" title="wip/tileout-effect branch">branch</a> of a <a href="http://media-explorer.github.com/" title="media explorer">media explorer</a> I'm currently working on. A few bullet points to follow the code:<br /><ul><li>As the effect needs a "screenshot" of a Clutter scene to play with. You first need to create a subclass of <code>ClutterOffscreenEffect</code> as it does the work of redirecting the painting of a subtree of actors in an offscreen buffer that you can&nbsp; reuse to texture the rectangles you'll be animating in the effect. This subclass has a "progress" property to control the animation.</li><li>Then actually compute the coordinates of the grid cells both in screen space and in texture space. To be able to use <code>cogl_rectangles_with_texture_coords()</code>, to try limit the number of GL calls (and/or by the Cogl journal and to ease the animation of the cells fading out, I decided to store the diagonals of the rectangle in a 1D array so that the following grid:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LKxVkdVadYU/VrdK93frakI/AAAAAAAAAaw/A-p7eH2wuUI/s1600/grild-diagonals.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LKxVkdVadYU/VrdK93frakI/AAAAAAAAAaw/A-p7eH2wuUI/s1600/grild-diagonals.png" /></a></div><br />is stored as the following array:<br /></li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JoSoRE8iPwk/VrdK903MEpI/AAAAAAAAAas/JOGg9ckytpA/s1600/tileout-1d-rects.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="32" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JoSoRE8iPwk/VrdK903MEpI/AAAAAAAAAas/JOGg9ckytpA/s320/tileout-1d-rects.png" width="320" /></a></div></div><ul><li><code>::paint_target()</code>looks at the "progress" property, animate those grid cells accordingly and draw them. <code>priv-&gt;rects</code> is the array storing the initial rectangles, <code>priv-&gt;animated_rects</code> the animated ones and <code>priv-&gt;chunks</code> stores the start and duration of each diagonal animation along with a (index, length) tuple that references the diagonal rectangles in priv-&gt;rects and priv-&gt;animated_rects.</li></ul>Some more details:<br /><ul><li>in the <code>::paint_target()</code> function, you can special case when the progress is 0.0 (paint the whole FBO instead of the textured grid) and 1.0 (don't do anything),</li><li>Clutter does not currently allow to just rerun the effect when you animate a property of an offscreen effect for instance. This means that when animating the "progress" property on the effect, it queues a redraw on the actor that end up in the offscreen to trigger the effect <code>::paint_target()</code> again. A branch from <a href="http://busydoingnothing.co.uk/" title="Neil">Neil</a> allows to queue a "rerun" on the effect to avoid having to do that,</li><li>The code has some limitations right now (ie, n_colums must be equal to n_rows) but easily fixable. Once done, it makes sense to try to push the effect to <a href="https://github.com/clutter-project/mx" title="Mx">Mx</a>.</li></ul></div></div>
