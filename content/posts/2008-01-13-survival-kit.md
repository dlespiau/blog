It's time to start putting something on the site. It's just a bunch of dot files (.vimrc, .gitconfig, ...) in a <a href="http://git.lespiau.name/cgit/sk/tree/">git repository</a>. I've called it my Survival Kit as these are files I cannot work without. I hope to make the repository more useful over time, adding simple skeletons to start (DocBook, C, Java, C#, ...) projects.
